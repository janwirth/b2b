# TDD Rules

- Run tests: `bun run test`
- Available steps `b2b-dev cheatsheet`
- Features: `features/*.feature`
- Step definitions: `steps.ts`

## New Feature Flow

1. Add feature file with description (annotate with `@focus` to focus on it)
2. Update mock server if needed
3. Add step definitions in `steps.ts`
4. Verify with `bun run test`
5. Remove `@focus` annotation
